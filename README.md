# Farm Management System (FMS)

## Overview
The Farm Management System (FMS) is a command-line application developed in Python to help farmers manage their farm data, including expenses and crops. This application allows users to add, view, and update farm-related information through a simple command-line interface.

## Features
- Add expenses: Users can add expenses with details such as amount, category, and description.
- Add crops: Users can add crops with details such as name, planting date, and variety.
- View expenses: Users can view a list of all expenses recorded.
- View crops: Users can view a list of all crops recorded.

## Usage
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the command `python farm_management_system.py` to start the application.
5. Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the Farm Management System.

## File Structure
- `farm_management_system.py`: The main Python script containing the application logic.
- `expenses.txt`: Text file storing the recorded expenses.
- `crops.txt`: Text file storing the recorded crops.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Notes
- Existing data is saved to and loaded from text files (`expenses.txt` and `crops.txt`) to maintain persistence between sessions.
- This is a basic version of the Farm Management System and may be expanded with additional features and improvements in the future.
